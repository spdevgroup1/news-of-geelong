Four dead as migrant vessel overturns in rough surf off San Diego coast

MAIN STORY


Four people died and four others were hospitalized after a wooden boat carrying suspected migrants overturned in turbulent waters off the San Diego coast late Friday night, authorities said.

The US Coast Guard said on Saturday that it was still searching for additional people who may have been aboard the panga-style vessel when it capsized in the waters off the coast of Imperial Beach Drive around 11:40 p.m. local time on Friday, according to an official press release.

The tragedy took place as a powerful storm system battered Southern California with heavy rain and dangerous surf conditions over the weekend, prompting flash flood and mudslide warnings across the region.

Imperial Beach Border Patrol agents had been monitoring the small vessel as it crossed out of Mexican waters before receiving reports that it had overturned, throwing passengers into the Pacific, Imperial Beach Fire Chief John French told NBC San Diego.

Within minutes of the capsizing, emergency responders found six people on the beach just before midnight, the Coast Guard said.

One person was pronounced dead at the scene, while another was pulled from beneath the overturned boat and rescued.

Roughly two hours later, at 1:45 a.m. local time, a Good Samaritan reported seeing someone in the water near Imperial Beach Pier.

A Coast Guard boat crew from Station San Diego responded and recovered three people from the ocean. All three were pronounced dead after being transferred to Ballast Point, according to the Coast Guard’s official timeline.

One body was discovered floating near homes on Seacoast Drive and Encanto Avenue, NBC San Diego reported.

Emergency medical services transported four survivors to a nearby hospital for treatment, according to multiple outlets.

One person was taken into custody by Imperial Beach Border Patrol and later transferred to a Department of Homeland Security agency, the Coast Guard said.

Several of those aboard claimed Mexican nationality, while others remained unidentified Saturday, authorities said.
